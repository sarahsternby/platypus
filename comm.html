<h2>Animal Communication</h2>
<h3>Some facts about how they communicate</h3>
<ul>
<li>The platypus hunts in the water, mostly at night.</li>
<li>Hearing and vision are therefore of little use in detecting the small aquatic invertebrates on which the animals primarily feed.
 Reflecting this fact, a platypus protects its eyes and ears by automatically closing them underwater and instead relies on its bill to locate prey.
</li>
<li>The upper and lower bill surfaces are packed with hundreds of receptors which respond to touch and the tiny electric currents produced when invertebrates move in the water.
</li>
<li>Platypus are specifically adapted to forage in the water and there are no reliable records of the animals feeding on dry land, although they sometimes search for prey at the waterâ€™s edge by digging under rocks or among the roots of streamside plants.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some other facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>While diving, the platypus temporarily stores small food items in special cheek pouches. When the animal returns to the surface to breathe, the food is ground up very finely between rough pads located inside the bill.
</li>
<li>While juvenile platypus have proper teeth, these fall out soon after the young first enter the water.
</li>
<li>The tail of the platypus stores fat for periods of low food supply, or for when the female burrows to breed.
